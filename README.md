# Expanding Florence-2's Vocabulary: An Advanced Guide to Adding Custom Tokens During Fine-Tuning
## Overview
This repository contains an **updated version** of the `processing_florence2.py` file, which extends the **Florence-2 vision-language model (VLM)** with **custom tokens** and **expanded vocabulary** for fine-tuning. These modifications enhance the modelâ€™s ability to understand specialized image attributes in a **single inference pass**, reducing redundancy and improving accuracy.

Detailed explanations of this modification process can be found in the **Medium blog post:**

## Why Expand Florence-2â€™s Vocabulary?
While Florence-2 is a powerful open-source multimodal model, it may struggle with **domain-specific terminology** or **visual elements** unique to specialized applications. This update is particularly useful for:
- **Sports Analysis** â€“ Extracting player attributes such as **jersey number, pose, emotion, and team name**.
- **Medical Image Processing** â€“ Identifying anatomical structures and medical conditions.
- **E-Commerce Tagging** â€“ Enhancing product descriptions with structured metadata.

## Key Enhancements in `processing_florence2.py`

1. **Custom Token Integration**
   - Introduces domain-specific tokens such as `<emo>`, `<pose>`, `<team>`, and `<color>`.
   - Allows the model to generate structured outputs containing these tokens.

2. **Tokenizer Update**
   - Modifies `tokenizer.json` to recognize and process new tokens.
   - Ensures token embeddings align with Florence-2â€™s existing vocabulary.

3. **New Task Definition**
   - Adds a new pipeline task to extract structured **player attributes**.
   - Maps input prompts to the appropriate Florence-2 processing functions.

4. **Enhanced Post-Processing**
   - Implements output formatting to improve structured data retrieval.
   - Ensures bounding box and metadata alignment for downstream applications.


## Explanation of `custom_caption_dataset.py`

The `custom_caption_dataset.py` file defines a PyTorch dataset class that processes images and their corresponding JSON annotations for training and fine-tuning Florence-2 with structured captions. It ensures proper dataset preparation by loading, filtering, and formatting annotations into a structured format.

### Key Features
1. **Dataset Splitting** â€“ The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets based on predefined percentages.
2. **Tokenized Captions** â€“ Converts raw annotations into structured text with predefined tokens (e.g., `<emo>` for emotion, `<pose>` for pose).
3. **Image-Annotation Pairing** â€“ Matches each image with its corresponding annotation JSON file.
4. **Annotation Parsing** â€“ Extracts and formats relevant attributes such as character coordinates, team names, and general descriptions.
5. **Configurable Settings** â€“ Allows customization of caption keys, number of characters processed, and whether to tokenize outputs.

### How It Works
- The dataset scans a folder containing images and their corresponding JSON annotations.
- It reads and filters relevant attributes from the JSON files.
- It converts the attributes into a structured text format, replacing raw values with predefined tokens.
- It loads image-caption pairs into a PyTorch dataset for use in training models like Florence-2.

### Example Usage
```python
from pathlib import Path
from custom_caption_dataset import CustomCaptionDataset

images_folder = Path("/path/to/images")
jsons_folder = Path("/path/to/annotations")
split = "train"
caption_keys = ["character_coordinates", "emotion", "pose", "jersey_color", "jersey_number", "jersey_name", "general_description"]

dataset = CustomCaptionDataset(
    split=split,
    images_folder=images_folder,
    jsons_folder=jsons_folder,
    caption_keys=caption_keys,
    convert_to_tokens=True
)

print(dataset[0])
print(f"Dataset size: {len(dataset)}")
```


## Example of an Annotation File

The `example_of_annotations_file.json` provides a structured format for image metadata, including details about the scene, characters, and their attributes.

### JSON Structure
```json
